                            Hello, my name is Ray. At just 13 years old I started making my way into the world of software engineering. I started with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic" target="_BLANK" rel="nofollow">Visual Basic 6</a> and created some small but simple programs, such as a cookie cleaner. Eventually I moved into VS.NET and made an mp3 audio converter, which at the time achieved a few thousand downloads. It was a huge success for my first ever publicly released program. The program actually made it onto a tech blog. I've tried to locate it again but unfortunately I cannot find it.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In 2006 I started expanding to the web development world, starting with HTML and PHP. I dove right in, and I kept at it everyday for at least a year. In that time I was playing around with modifying forum software such as SMF and phpBB. But I didn't stop there. I've created some PHP based API scripts that connected to some game servers to retrieve information from the servers and also learned OOP along the way.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For fun I've also created game modifications, which was written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque_(game_engine)" target="_BLANK" rel="nofollow">TorqueScript</a>. Some of my game modifications achieved over 20,000 downloads and was used by many servers for a period of time.
                        </p>

                        <p>And now fast forward to 2016, I'm attending <a href="https://codingbootcamp.rutgers.edu/" target="_BLANK" rel="nofollow">Rutgers Coding Bootcamp</a> to fill the gaps I'm missing, meet new people and finally make web development of career of choice as it's something I really enjoy doing.
